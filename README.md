# svhip_Dev
Development of SVhip, a software for ncRNA classifier retrainig.

IMPORTANT !!!!!!!

This repository explicitely hosts the experimental version, where new features are tried/added, stuff is moved around... the works.
Do, for now, not expect for everything to work out of the box.

A working prototype DOES exist and can be obtained either from christopher or http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/Svhip/.
